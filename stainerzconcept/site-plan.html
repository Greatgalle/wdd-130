      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        We describe this as the initial point of contact between the company and the website visitors. It can be a home page or any other page. As the reception of your brick-and-mortar office, it is the welcoming room. It can either make the prospect want to hang around and learn more or send them straight to the close button. Unlike your reception, there will be no one to stop them, there is no receptionist whose warm smile might make them want to give you a second chance.
        So, I will have to make my page speak for itself. I will use color, design and well-placed texts to get and hold the attention of the visitor and direct them to act. But more importantly, I will use a knowledge of why the visitor is there to preempt and answer their questions.
